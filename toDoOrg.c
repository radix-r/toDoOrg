/*

This is a relitivly simple program that orginizes a to do list with
a specific format. This program reads the name of a text file from the command
line and sorts the lines base on what the start with and potentaly the date
associated with the line.

It follows the gerneral rule that lines that start with "(X)" , "(Ã—)" , "(:C)",
or "(:c)" should go below line that dont start with those strings.

Also as an added goal I would like to recognize dates in the for <month>/<day>
and sort the lines based on that with later dates twords the top of the list. I
could probably do this using a priority queue where the value of the line is
31*<month>+<day>. This, however would not work well for goals that hapen after
the new year.
